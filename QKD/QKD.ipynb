    "## BB84 protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the steps of the BB84 protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first step, Alice chooses two random bit strings, $k$ and $b$, that each consist of $n$ bits. Her bit string $k$ contains the actual bits she wants to encode (out of which the key will later be formed), while $b$ determines the bases in which she will encode her bits. For $b_i=0$ (i.e., if the $i^{th}$ bit is zero), she encodes the $i^{th}$ qubit in the standard $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle \\}$ basis, while for $b_i=1$, she encodes it in the $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle \\}$ basis, where $|+\\rangle:=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle +|1\\rangle)$, $|-\\rangle:=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle -|1\\rangle)$. \n",
    "This becomes more illustrative when representing each basis by two perpendicular arrows, where the two different bases are rotated by $45^\\circ$.\n",
    "The encoding of each qubit $q_i$ would therefore look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/encoding_Alice.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After encoding her $n$ qubits, Alice sends these qubits to Bob. Bob also chooses a random bit string $\\tilde{b}$ consisting of $n$ bits that determines in which bases he is going to perform measurements. He stores the outcomes of his measurements $\\tilde{k_i}$ together with the corresponding basis bits $\\tilde{b_i}$ in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, Alice and Bob compare their basis bits $b_i$ and $\\tilde{b}_i$. Whenever $b_i \\neq \\tilde{b}_i$, Bob measured in a different basis than Alice's qubit was encoded in, so he gets each outcome with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Alice and Bob therefore discard all key bits corresponding to these basis bits. If $b_i = \\tilde{b}_i$, however, they prepared and measured the qubit in the same basis, so (unless someone eavesdropped) Bob will get the key bit that Alice encoded, $\\tilde{k}_i = k_i$. These outcomes then compose the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An illustrated example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Alice's random bit strings are $k=`0111001`$ and $b=`1101000`$ and Bob's random bit string is $\\tilde{b}=`1001101`$. Try to understand the other entries in the table below. Note that in the case where the basis bits are different, Bob has a 50% chance to get each outcome, so here one of them was chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/example_bb84.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key produced in this example would be '0110'. To make sure that the key is secret and correct, Alice and Bob would \"sacrifice\" some of their key bits to check that no one eavesdropped. If someone had measured a qubit on the way, this could have changed the state of that qubit and with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, Bob's and Alice's key bits will be different. By checking $m$ bits, the probability to not notice an eavesdropper decreases as $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^m$. Thus, if they check enough bits and they are all the same, they can assume that no one eavesdropped and their key is secret."

    "### Message encrpytion\n",
    "Once a secret key is distributed, Alice can encrypt her message by using the so-called [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) technique: she simply adds the key bits on top of her secret message bits that she wants to send. Using the example above, her key is $\\text{key}=`0110`$. If her secret message bit string is $m=`1100`$, the encrypted message will be $c=m\\oplus \\text{key} \\mod 2 = `1010`$. Bob can then decrypt the message by adding his key on that encrypted message, $m=c\\oplus \\text{key} \\mod 2$."

    "Up to now, Eve did exactly what Bob did in the previous example. From this point on, however, things are a bit tricky. Eve has measured the state causing qubits to collapse in different eigenstates. This property is not easy to implement in QISKit because measurement results are stored in classical registered, while the qubits themselves are \"unchanged\". Therefore we need to update Eve's qubits to the new altered states starting from the results of the measures (Eve's key), reversing the instructions that Eve has executed, and apply them to qubits when necessary, which means when the basis choice was different.\n",
